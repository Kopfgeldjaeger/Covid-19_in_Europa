# Covid-19_in_Europa
because of the potential danger of Covid-19 infection, we need daily pay attention to the news, specially the number of infections.
it was safe in Europa not far earlier.
today but not any more.
so we need a web scraper to get the informations online and analyse it, predict the infection trend in the future in Europa.
the Virus spreads very quickly in Italy, Spain, Germany and France.
so i made a Plot of the Data about these four countries and predicted the situation in 10 days with ARIMA, if you'd like you can also predict it in one year.
Unfortunately the Math theory is not so strong that it reveals actual truth always. Besides we have to overcome the curse of covid-19.
It shall be just a supposation.
I wrote it with Colab, i am not familier with web scraping, so i looked for reference online, luckily i found one:  https://blog.furas.pl/python-scraping-how-to-get-data-from-interactive-plot-created-with-highcharts-gb.html

I hope my code help you with defencing the virus.
and stay health.
